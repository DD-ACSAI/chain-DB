Hello! This is Dario Loi's and Davide Marincione's project.
Here's all the files relevant to our project, there's two backups (just one should be enough)
which (we hope) should be suitable created with:
- "Custom" file-format
- UTF8 encoding
- Pre-Data, Data, Post-Data and Blobs toggles asserted in the Data/Objects window

In case the backups don't want to collaborate we've added a copy of all our operations in .txt format.

Furthermore we leave a copy of our codebase with an already compiled .exe along (runs only on Windows!).

And finally we also add a video showing how our system works, to be completely sure you'll be able to see it
we've also uploaded it on youtube (not listed to avoid random people getting in,
but if you want to show it in the future for the sake of this course we grant you the permission to do so)
