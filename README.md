# star-DB
Relation Database representing a variety of astronomical objects at different scales and the way that they relate between eachother.

## Project Goals
We aim to provide:

* A conceptual E/R model in order to allow any viewer to grasp the relations and concepts at hand at a quick glance
* An implementation in MySQL using the XAMPP platform as a local webserver, this means a Tech Stack composed of:
  1. PHP
  2. JS/JQuery
  3. HTML/CSS (Bootstrap or any other frontend framework)
* The aformentioned Tech Stack will be used (As a final milestone, and only once we are sure that we have a minimal working example of the Database) to develop
a website that the User can use to perform queries and interact with the database, possibly navigating the relations inbetween the astronomical objects dynamically 
and allowing him to visualize the data in a graphically pleasing way.

## Why Space?
The first and most logical reason that we provide for the choice of our project is: *space is cool*, the more academical one is that astronomy and orbital mechanics is a game of relationships: Moons orbit Planets, Planets orbit Stars and Stars orbit Galaxies, with anything inbetween being related through the fundamental force of gravity.

We can also use this wide scenario (practically the whole universe) to store data about scientifical discoveries and events/anomalies that are located in certain points in space and related to certain astronomical bodies, and, in turn, also store information about the scientists that performed these discoveries and their respective organizations.
