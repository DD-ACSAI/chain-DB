% Should we use twocolumn or onecolumn?
%   D: I vouch for twocolumn since it is more compact and I
%       expect to draw the ER-Diag in a whole page for itself.
%       (Don't think something bigger will ever be in the doc)
% Using draft mode for now
% \documentclass[a4paper, twocolumn, draft]{article}
% Also, what style do we want to use? I suggest: IEEETran
\documentclass[a4paper, draft, technote, twocolumn, romanappendices]{IEEEtran}

    \begin{abstract}
        Our objective is to build a database representing the relationships
        in supply chains and provide information about the possible routes
        and their methods of transportation: both for raw materials and
        manufactured goods and their respective centers of production.
        The implementation will provide utility tools for possible users
        to make informed decisions about the best course of
        action when facing the logistical challenges of distribution.
